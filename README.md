# Delibird / Birb-bot

Delibird / Birb-bot is a Mastodon bot flying from user to user!

It can be sent by an user to another by mentioning the bird with a message like
“Go see user@domain” or with similar keywords. It can only be at one place at a
time, though, meaning that when it is flying away to someone or it is visiting
someone else than you, you cannot send it flying to another user!

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- Mastodon.py: https://github.com/halcy/Mastodon.py/

## Writing your own birbs

To avoid spoilers around the “rewards” posted by my own birb-bot, the repo does
not include the full “data.py” I use.

Instead, you can find a “data.py.example” which is pretty close but omits some
rewards and media definitions.
